In this post I want to introduce you to a great ggplot2 add-on, ggthemes.
ggthemes which is freely available on [github](https://github.com/jrnold/ggthemes), let you turn your current plots to professional looking plots in a matter of a couple of lines of code.

{/* <!-- more --> */}

ggthemes has various of different themes such as `The Economist`, `Excel` and various other professional themes that makes your current plots much fancier.

Here is a plot that I made for one of my assignments this year using this library.
