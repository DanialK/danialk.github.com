### Background

Back in 2022, I had plans to dive into the world of custom ergonomic keyboards and I got myself a Creality Ender 3 Pro 3D printer and
stepped into the world of 3D printing, but life happened, and the only thing I ended up printing was a couple of utility items for around the house.
Fast forward to July 2024, I randomly came across the [Building Dactyl Cygnus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_ex-oMVOrI) video on YouTube, and it instantly reignited that old spark.
I loved how sleek the design was, especially with the use of PCBs and the support for hot swapping keys.

So, I went ahead and printed a Dactyl Cygnus, but quickly realized that maybe starting with a split, 36-key layout wasnâ€™t the smartest move for my first build.
It was probably going to be a huge adjustment from my regular keyboard. It felt like too big of a leap into the world of split or ortholinear keyboards.

Instead, I did a bit more research and decided to go with Dactyl Manuform Mini 5x6. I preferred it over the bulkier look of the original non-mini Dactyl Manuform variant.

### Research

The original [l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard) had a few little design choices that I didn't like such as

- the inserted nut holders would be sticking out of the exterior of the keyboard
- Missing STL for the bottom plate (at this point in the journey I did not know how to create one myself using the 2D files provided for laser cutting)
- Holes to be able to screw in su120 PCBs just like the [Dactyl Cygnus](https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards/tree/main/Cygnus%20v1.0#single-switch-pcbs)

I found the [bstiq/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard](https://github.com/bstiq/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard/) fork and its fork [joseandres42/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard](https://github.com/joseandres42/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard) and this looked like it had
most things I wanted.

At this point, I hadn't done much more research, didn't have the time to spend on learning and customizing the closure files to my liking and wanted to make some progress so I decided to just go
ahead with printing the files from [joseandres42/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard](https://github.com/joseandres42/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard).
It was missing the holes, but I thought I'd just super glue them in place (I ran into issues, but designed a solution you'll see below).

## Resources

These are the two main resources I followed but there are plenty of videos on YouTube that I watched but most of the things I had to learn or plan to buy were from these two following resources

- [Complete idiot guide for building a dactyl manuform keyboard](https://medium.com/swlh/complete-idiot-guide-for-building-a-dactyl-manuform-keyboard-53454845b065)
- [Dactyl Cygnus Build Guide](https://github.com/juhakaup/keyboards/tree/main/Cygnus%20v1.0)

### Dactyl Manuform Mini 5x6 Build

#### 3D-Printing using normal support

I printed the keyboards on my stock Ender-3 Pro using PLA with OrcaSlicer.
The only settings I changed was setting the first layer's line width to 125% for better adhesion which is something I always do.

The body was printed so cleanly and the white PLA easily hid any imperfections so I decided to actually not prime and paint this build.
Originally, I had planned to paint it white anyways.
In hindsight, I should've put a clear protective coat on it just so it's easier to clean it.

#### Soldering the PCBs

Ordered the PCBs from [https://jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com) and followed the [Building Dactyl Cygnus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_ex-oMVOrI) guide on how to solder them.

#### Fitting hot-swappable su120 PCBs

After removing the supports, I put a few switches in and connected the su120s and realized there was a 2mm gap between the PCB and the keyboard body
which meant I couldn't glue the PCBs to the body like I had originally planned.

So I used Tinkercad to design some small 2mm brackets that could fit between the PCBs and the keyboard body to solve the problem.

This meant that now I had an additional step in the build plan. That is first, glue 62 of these brackets to the body under the switch holes.

And then, glued the 62 PCBs to the brackets

#### Iterating on the bottom plate

With the bracket and the su120 PCBs, the original bottom plates from [joseandres42/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard](https://github.com/joseandres42/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard) did not properly close.
So once again, I had to resort to Tinkercad to design a custom bottom plate that had edges with at least 5mm space where the electronics and cables could fit nicely.

#### Wiring up the grid and soldering the electronics

### Key switches

I went with Gateron G Pro 3.0 brown switches which is very similar to what I have on my Keychron K2 keyboard that I use daily.

### Keycaps

At this point, I hadn't done much research on keycaps and all the profiles but I picked up these green OEM Profile, PBT Keycaps from Temu for really cheap and I love them!

## Conclusion and Learnings

Overall, building this keyboard was a very fun experience and it was fun learning how to design basic things in Tinkercad to solve the problems I was having.

Since then, I've discovered [ergohaven/dactyl-keyboard](https://github.com/ergohaven/dactyl-keyboard) and if I was starting from scratch, I would use https://github.com/ergohaven/dactyl-keyboard which is configured in python and has support for 5x6 mini Dactyls as well as holes for screwing in su120s and more.

I also learnt about [https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/](https://ryanis.cool/cosmos/), which is a cool project that is worth checking out.

## Github

I backed up the STLs and Gerber files I used for this build in the following repo
