Hey! I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with a rich background in everything from Front-End to Back-End Development, and Data Engineering. Most recently, I've focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I thrive on combining these diverse skills to build seamless, data-driven applications that are as powerful under the hood as they are sleek on the surface. This blog is my casual space to share my nerdy projects or hobbiesâ€”though I might only update it once every couple of years!
